Mini-projects Java, IUT de Valence, 2013-2014, group IE1, project 6

This little project consists in a naval battle game. It will be developed in two forms : right in the console, then with a GUI.
The player will be able to play against the computer, or against a friend, on the same computer or online. 
The way it works is simple : place your ships, then begin to fight by exchanging shots. 
The first one to destroy all the ships of his adversary wins !
